// Rellax
// 0.1.0
// A module to provide smooth scrolling and parallax!
// >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
// Before starting, you must create the following Custom Properties
// in AGS Editor, for usage with Objects.
// Just click on Properties [...] and on the Edit Custom Properties screen,
// click on Edit Schema ... button, and add the two properties below:
//
// PxPos:
//    Name: PxPos
//    Description: Object's horizontal parallax
//    Type: Number
//    Default Value: 0
//
// PyPos:
//    Name: PyPos
//    Description: Object's vertical parallax
//    Type: Number
//    Default Value: 0
//
//  The number defined on Px or Py will be divided by 100 and used to increase
// the scrolling. An object with Px and Py 0 is scrolled normally, an object
// with Px and Py 100 will be fixed on the screen despite camera movement.
//
